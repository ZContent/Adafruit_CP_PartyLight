# Adafruit_CP_PartyLight
Party Light for Adafruit's Circuit Playground

The Party light uses an Adafruit Circuit Playground and a paper lantern.
Use a USB cable to hold CP in the center of lantern. A long USB cable is
suggested. Attach an alligator clip between pin 0 (may be changed in code) 
and the paper lantern's wire frame to enable the touch interface.
 
NOTE: Do not let the Circuit Playground touch the paper lantern, the
Circuit Playground can get warm. Keep it in the center of the lantern.
 
The touch interface does the following:
Short touch - turn lamp on or change the lamp color to one of 7 colors
Long toucn - turn brightness up or down, or turn lantern off 
 
Letting go while dimming will keep the brightness at that level. A long touch
after release will increase the brightness. If held long enough while dimming,
the party light will turn off.
